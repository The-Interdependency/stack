# A UCNS Key-Encapsulation Feasibility Investigation

**Status:** Research note. Reports a sequence of measured attacks against
candidate UCNS-based key-encapsulation (KEM) domains for PCEA-UCNS. It
establishes **no positive security claim** beyond what each measurement
licenses; it does establish, at exact strength, which candidate
constructions are refuted and which survive their most natural attacks.

**Method discipline:** every result below is produced by a reproducible
harness in `pcea-ucns/` and pinned by a test in `tests/` (skipped when
ucns is absent). All attacks use the *real* UCNS factorization tools —
`factor_search_v08`, `left_quotient`, and the Carrier-LCM-Law pruning
corollaries — pointed adversarially. Numbers are reproduced from a single
harvest run; seeds and parameters are in the harnesses.

**Accreditation:** Claude generated from repository context as prompted by
Erin Spencer. Reproduced against The-Interdependency/ucns at the
Carrier-LCM Law + pruning + canonical-selection release.

## The question

PCEA is a sound symmetric keyed transform; it is not asymmetric (see
`PLAN.md`, `contract.py`). A UCNS-KEM would supply the missing primitive,
with a private key recoverable only by solving a UCNS problem believed
hard. The investigation asks, empirically: **is there a UCNS construction
whose private key resists recovery by the factorization tools UCNS already
ships?**

## The arc, in six steps

Each step overturned or sharpened the previous; the conclusion is neither
"secure" nor "broken" but a precisely located open problem.

### 1. Carrier choice is not a hiding place (refuted)

By the Carrier-LCM Law, `n_min(A ⊠ B) = lcm(n_min(A), n_min(B))`. Measured:
private carrier supports {2} and {2,5} yield public carrier 80 with support
exactly {2,5}. The public product's carrier reveals the union of the
factors' carrier supports. **A secret in carrier choice is public by
construction.** (`attack_harness.py`)

### 2. The oracle domain is exhaustively breakable (forbidden)

On the frozen depth-2 oracle domain — ORACLE-COMPLETE in the UCNS ledger —
`factor_search_v08` recovers 52/60 (~87%) of random products. **Forbidden
for keys.** (`attack_harness.py`)

### 3. Angle position at fixed carrier is not a hiding place (refuted)

The v0 spec conjectured a key could hide in angle position / face / payload
at a fixed public carrier. Measured at carriers 15, 40, 105: recompose
**60/60**, exact private factor ~48%, no improvement with larger carrier.
Fixing the carrier removes the carrier leak but leaves the whole
factorization attack intact, and **non-uniqueness means the attacker needs
only some recomposing pair, not the exact key.** (`positional_attack.py`)

### 4. Ordered triple products: partial protection, not safety

For `P = A ⊠ B ⊠ C` with C private: recompose 80/80, but the first split is
**never** the clean (A⊠B, C) — 0/80. Ordered composition smears the
private-factor boundary. Yet recursive peeling still recovers C ~49%.
**Degraded, not defeated.** (`three_factor_attack.py`)

### 5. Factor count is irrelevant; non-uniqueness looked fatal

Recovery does not decay with factor count (2..6 factors: ~40–67%, flat).
For a 5-factor product the search finds the true ordered (prefix, C) split
0/80 and some other valid decomposition 80/80 — **the public product has
many ordered factorizations.** This appeared to defeat any KEM: bind the
secret to any decomposition and the attacker supplies one; bind it to the
unique true one and honest parties cannot recover it. (`factor_count_sweep.py`)

### 6. The quotient corrects the verdict (hardness relocated)

The previous step measured the full object space. The `left_quotient`
primitive, restricted to a finite key space, disagrees: given public
`P = A ⊠ B` with A, B in the key space, the number of key-space candidates
that left-divide P is **mean ~1.1, max 2** — the private factor is nearly
*unique within the key space*. The factorizer's many decompositions land
**outside** the key space ~55% of the time; they are not usable keys.
**Full-space non-uniqueness does not defeat a key-space-restricted KEM.**
(`quotient_attack.py`)

### 7. The break attempt fails — constant-factor, not polynomial

The relocated danger: a quotient-*guided* search beating brute-force
enumeration. Two cheap attacks — prefix-angle ordering, and the cipher's
own carrier-support pruning turned adversarial — measured by scaling in
|key space| from 40 to 1000:

| Attack | Cost scaling | ratio-to-\|KS\| |
|---|---|---|
| Prefix-angle ordering | ~ \|KS\|^0.89 | flat ~0.10 |
| Carrier-support + prefix prune | ~ \|KS\|^1.03 | flat ~0.10 |

A polynomial break shows ratio → 0; here it holds flat. Both attacks are
**constant-factor (Θ(\|KS\|))** — they reorder the search, they do not
shrink it. A ~10× constant is absorbed by a few key bits.
(`pruning_scaling.py`)

### 8. The prefix-read break ends it (decisive negative)

The pruning-scaling result eliminated linear-search attacks and flagged a
sublinear/algebraic attack as the last danger. It exists, and it is worse
than sublinear — it is **independent of key-space size and payload
depth.** UCNS normalization puts a factor's first host angle at 0, so in
`P = A ⊠ B` the prefix block `P[0:q]` *is* B's host data verbatim (this is
Phase 1 of `left_quotient` itself). The attacker reads the prefix block as
candidate B and recovers A by `right_quotient` — no key-space enumeration.

Measured: reconstruction **100/100** (flat), **80/80** (depth-1 nested).
Payload nesting does not block it; `right_quotient` absorbs the composed
payloads. Cost is O(divisors(|P.A_plus|)). (`prefix_read_break.py`)

**The key-space-restricted UCNS-KEM regime is broken.** Making the key
space large or the objects deep does not help, because the attack never
enumerates the key space and the quotient handles the depth.

## What is established

- **Refuted constructions:** carrier-choice keys; fixed-carrier
  angle-position keys; oracle-domain keys; reliance on full-space
  factorization hardness; **and — decisively — the entire
  forward-composition-plus-quotient KEM construction, broken by prefix
  reconstruction at any key-space size and any depth.**
- **The surviving regime did not survive.** Steps 6–7 showed the
  key-space-restricted regime resists *enumeration* attacks; step 8 shows
  it falls to *reconstruction*, which enumeration-hardness never
  addressed. The lesson is precise: key-space size was always the wrong
  security parameter, because the public product leaks a factor
  structurally, not statistically.
- **Not refuted:** the possibility of *some* UCNS asymmetric primitive.
  What is closed is this construction. Any future candidate must defeat
  prefix reconstruction — which means the public key cannot be a forward
  product whose prefix is a normalized factor.

## The open problem, restated after the break

> Can a UCNS public object be formed so that no factor is recoverable from
> its prefix (or any positional) structure by the quotient — i.e. a
> one-way UCNS map whose inverse is not exposed by normalization?

Forward composition is not that map: normalization is constitutive to
UCNS, and it is exactly what the break exploits. A candidate would need a
public projection that breaks the angle-0 prefix correspondence while
remaining a valid UCNS object — currently not known to exist. This is a
cleaner and harder question than where the investigation began, and it is
the honest terminus: **PCEA-UCNS as a forward-composition KEM is closed;
a different UCNS one-way map is required and is not in hand.**



## Relationship to PCEA's shipped claims

None of this changes PCEA's current status. PCEA remains a sound symmetric
transform whose security rests on key management (`contract.py`); the
asymmetric UCNS-KEM remains experimental and unproven. If the open problem
resolves toward an attack, PCEA-UCNS falls back to symmetric-only, which
the contract already guarantees. If it resolves toward hardness, PCEA-UCNS
becomes a candidate public-key construction — pending formal review, never
self-certified.

## Postscript: the lossy-projection candidate and its break

After the general barrier, a lossy-projection action
(set-project(s ⊠ g)) was found to be one-way against the QUOTIENT
(inverts 3/200) and injective with scalable entropy — the first
counterexample to the barrier as originally stated. Open Attack 1 then
broke it: the action's angles are a Minkowski sum {a_i + g_j mod 4}, and
an attacker recovers a usable secret by set-basis cover, at cost that
plateaus while the brute key space grows quadratically (asymptotic break).

Amended barrier: a UCNS public map is broken if its image admits ANY
efficient inverse, not only the quotient. Set-projection relocates
invertibility from quotient to Minkowski-sum; it does not remove it. A
UCNS-native one-way map must defeat BOTH inverses simultaneously, and
nothing tested does. (attack1_minkowski_break.py)

## hmmm

- The arc's shape is itself the finding: a construction that is refuted in
  the full space and survives in a restricted one is exactly what a KEM is
  — RSA is trivial over the integers and hard only in the structured
  semiprime domain. The question was never "is UCNS hard" but "is there a
  UCNS domain where it is."
- The next probe ended it: the break is structural, not statistical. We
  stated both outcomes before running it, and the breaking outcome landed
  — recorded without rationalization. The value banked is a clean negative
  with reproducible harnesses, which is a stronger artifact than a hopeful
  "survives so far."
- The terminus reframes UCNS's relationship to cryptography honestly:
  normalization makes UCNS a transparent algebra, excellent for the
  factorization research it was built for, and for that exact reason a
  poor source of trapdoors. The two virtues are the same property seen
  from opposite sides.
