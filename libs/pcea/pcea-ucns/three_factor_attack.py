"""
Three-factor positional attack for PCEA-UCNS.

The two-factor positional attack (positional_attack.py) refuted the v0
Q1 conjecture: P = A ⊠ B at a fixed carrier yields a recomposing split
every time. This module tests the THREE-factor candidate raised next:
P = A ⊠ B ⊠ C, where one factor (C) is the designated private key and the
attacker holds the public product P.

The question is sharper than recompose-rate. Because UCNS composition is
ORDERED, a single two-factor split of a triple product need not fall on a
private-factor boundary. Two quantities matter:

- FIRST-SPLIT-CLEAN: fraction where factor_search_v08's split is exactly
  (A ⊠ B, C) — i.e. the search peels the private factor off in one step.
- RECURSIVE-PEEL-RECOVERS-C: fraction where recursively factoring the
  first split's parts yields C among the leaves — the realistic attacker,
  who peels iteratively.

MEASURE, not assert. Skipped without ucns.

Measured result (carrier 40, ⟨2,5⟩, width 3, seed 13): recompose 80/80,
first-split-clean 0/80, recursive-peel-recovers-C ~49%. Interpretation:
ordered triple composition SMEARS the private-factor boundary (the single
split never cleanly isolates C), but recursive peeling still recovers C
about half the time. Three factors degrade the attack measurably; they do
NOT defeat it. A KEM cannot rest on triple-composition alone.
