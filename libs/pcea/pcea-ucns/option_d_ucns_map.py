"""Concrete Option D UCNS map candidate fed into the one-way-map gate.

This is a candidate *specification*, not a cipher and not a security result. It
names one map family worth attacking next: a face/payload spectrum projection.
The map is intentionally not a published UCNS product. It composes a secret and
base internally, then publishes only coarse spectrum data: carrier support,
cell-count buckets, face-parity counts, payload-depth counts, and denominator
buckets. It withholds ordered cells, exact angle set, multiplicity, faces, and
payload bodies.

Rationale: previous candidates failed by publishing too much product structure
or by reducing to a Minkowski angle-set basis problem. This candidate asks
whether a coarser UCNS-derived spectrum can keep honest-party agreement while
denying quotient, prefix, and set-basis inverses. |∆|No harness has shown that
yet; this file only feeds the map into the required attack-agenda gate.|∆|
