Open Attack 1 resolved: the lossy-projection candidate is BROKEN.

projection_action_candidate.py listed five required attacks. Attack 1
(algebraic key-recovery exploiting the commuting structure) succeeds and
breaks the candidate.

Mechanism. action(a, g) = set-project(a ⊠ g) has angle set
{ (a_i + g_j) mod 4 } — a MINKOWSKI SUM of a's and g's angle sets. An
attacker who knows g (public) recovers a usable a by solving a set-basis
problem: find a small set S with S (+) g_set = ga_set, where (+) is
Minkowski sum mod 4. Candidate elements come from the difference set
{ x - g_j : x in ga, g_j in g }, and the minimal cover is found by small
combinations.

Measured:
- Success: ~40/40 recovery at every lattice size (11, 13, 19, 39 points),
  independent of lattice growth.
- Cost: set-basis operations PLATEAU (~950-975) while the brute-force key
  space grows quadratically in lattice size. At lattice 114 the attack is
  already ~7x faster than brute and the gap widens. The attack is
  ASYMPTOTICALLY superior — it wins precisely in the large-parameter
  regime a real cipher would use.

Why injectivity was a trap, not a strength. The action being injective on
secrets (collision factor 1.0x) made it a clean forward map — and a clean
forward map is a clean target for set-basis inversion. The Minkowski
structure that makes the action commute (hence honest agreement work) is
exactly what makes it invertible without the quotient.

CONCLUSION. The lossy-projection escape from the published-product
trilemma fails Attack 1. Set-projection defeats the QUOTIENT but not
Minkowski set-basis recovery. The candidate is not a one-way function: it
is one-way against one specific inverse (the quotient) and wide open to
another (set-basis). The general barrier stands in amended form:

  A UCNS public map is broken if its image admits ANY efficient inverse,
  not only the quotient. Set-projection trades the quotient inverse for a
  Minkowski-sum inverse; it does not remove invertibility, it relocates
  it. No tested UCNS operation is one-way against ALL natural inverses.

This closes the lossy-projection line. The honest engineering conclusion
returns to its prior state: ship Option 1 (pre-shared) or Option 2
(hybrid DH). Option 3 (a UCNS-native one-way map) remains open but now has
TWO obstructions a candidate must clear simultaneously — quotient AND
set-basis inversion — and nothing tested clears both.

Skipped without ucns.
