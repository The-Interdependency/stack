# Tarot corpus acquisition — evidence before ontology

Status: first executable acquisition surface. It creates an auditable Tarot evidence snapshot; it does **not** define Tarot, perform EDCM embedding, construct UCNS objects, or claim a Platonic Tarot card.

## Work graph

- archival, museum, library, rules, primary-text, and scholarship sources own their own source content and claims;
- EDCM owns this manifest, acquisition policy, evidence indexing, and later distinction/relation discovery;
- UCNS owns downstream recursive relation representation once EDCM has surfaced distinctions;
- `skill-lib` owns build/evidence discipline.

No relation transfers semantic authority, historical truth, copyright authority, measurement validity, mathematical proof status, or canon standing.

## Construction boundary

The Tarot corpus begins as evidence envelopes:

```text
source identity
provenance
source date
media type
rights state
retrieval policy
raw bytes when lawfully and exactly retrievable
byte digest
```

There is no predeclared card schema. In particular, acquisition does not globally equate cards across decks and does not require 78 cards, 22 trumps, four suits, one numbering, one court structure, reversals, astrology, Kabbalah, or divinatory meanings. Those may occur in source evidence and are preserved as source-relative material for later EDCM discovery.

## Frozen v1 seed

`corpus/tarot/sources.v1.json` seeds the corpus across early deck/material witnesses, historical collections, occult/divinatory primary texts, a living game-rules surface, modern institutional interpretation, scholarship, and one near-neighbor negative control.

Only two entries currently authorize automatic bytes: Wellcome Collection's public-domain Etteilla materials. Other entries remain metadata or manual-review locators until exact downloadable identity and reuse authority are pinned. This is deliberate fail-closed behavior, not an assertion that the other sources are less important.

## Usage

Validate the manifest without network or writes:

```bash
python tools/acquire_tarot_corpus.py --dry-run
```

Acquire authorized bytes and seal the snapshot:

```bash
python tools/acquire_tarot_corpus.py \
  --manifest corpus/tarot/sources.v1.json \
  --output artifacts/tarot/acquisition-v1
```

Resume an interrupted run or verify/reuse a completed run:

```bash
python tools/acquire_tarot_corpus.py \
  --manifest corpus/tarot/sources.v1.json \
  --output artifacts/tarot/acquisition-v1 \
  --resume
```

The runner streams downloads with a per-source byte ceiling, checkpoints completed sources, and fails closed on stale manifest identity, changed source entries, altered bytes, missing files, or injected files.

Validate the implementation:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_tarot_corpus_acquisition.py
python tools/check_metadata_contracts.py
```

## Next stage

The acquisition output is an input boundary for EDCM, not an embedding itself.
The first bounded discovery stage is now executable:

```bash
python tools/discover_tarot_relations.py \
  --manifest corpus/tarot/sources.v1.json \
  --acquisition artifacts/tarot/acquisition-v1 \
  --output artifacts/tarot/relations-v1.json
```

This stage validates the complete sealed acquisition, preserves manifest order
and exact field values, records typed absence, binds fetched artifacts, and
reports only same-field byte-exact agreement. It does not inspect PDF content,
tokenize or normalize language, infer card identity, select an ontology, build
UCNS objects, or run EDCM measurement. A single result remains `UNRESOLVED`;
repeat-run byte identity is determinism evidence only.

## Observation pivot

OCR is no longer a prerequisite for Tarot progress.

The Etteilla scans remain admitted evidence and their failed extraction history remains sealed. The exact v4 OCR instrument is `FALSIFIED`; that does not make historical typography recognition the next mandatory experiment.

Advance the corpus through three independent observation lanes:

1. **machine-readable text** — resolve exact identities and rights for already-transcribed or natively digital Tarot primary texts, rules, and institutional descriptions; preserve source order, wording, language, and provenance without semantic normalization;
2. **image-native evidence** — admit card, tableau, page, and deck images as image objects with exact source identity and provenance; do not require text extraction before relational discovery;
3. **historical scan text** — retain scanned historical texts as unresolved observation objects and revisit historical-type recognition only when the expected information gain justifies a new preregistered instrument.

No lane may silently manufacture cross-source card identity, ontology, meanings, correspondences, or canon. Relations discovered within one modality may later be compared with another only through explicit provenance-bearing mappings.

The wider path is now:

```text
Tarot evidence snapshot
    -> EDCM source-envelope distinction/relation discovery [implemented]
    -> observation lanes
         -> machine-readable text [NEXT]
         -> image-native evidence [NEXT]
         -> historical scanned text
              -> embedded-text extraction [FALSIFIED]
              -> OCR v1 [BLOCKED]
              -> OCR v2 [BLOCKED]
              -> OCR v3 [BLOCKED]
              -> OCR v4 [FALSIFIED]
              -> OCR v5 [FALSIFIED: detection recovered; accuracy failed]
              -> OCR v6 [BLOCKED: renderer configs unavailable]
              -> OCR v7 [FALSIFIED: book improved; source-wide gate failed]
              -> further whole-page OCR model substitution [STOPPED]
    -> source-relative multimodal observations
    -> semantic/relational discovery
    -> provenance-bearing recovered relations
    -> UCNS recursive objects
    -> reconstruction/adversarial tests
    -> hmmm: emergent Platonic Tarot card
```

EDCM should be allowed to discover that two sources agree, disagree, split, merge, omit, reinterpret, or fail to map. Acquisition and observation must not erase those possibilities by preprocessing them into one Tarot taxonomy.

## hmmm

- comprehensive source coverage is impossible to claim from v1;
- item-level IIIF and reuse identities remain unresolved for several major collections;
- modern commercial decks and guidebooks need source-specific lawful acquisition;
- OCR v4 completed all 407 pages but is FALSIFIED; 397/401 book TXT outputs are empty;
- OCR v5 recovered text on 392/401 book pages but is FALSIFIED by accuracy, one near-total book miss, and tableau false positives/negatives; no trustworthy transcription corpus exists;
- OCR v7's historic model brings book CER below its source threshold but leaves book WER above threshold and fails the visual tableau; further whole-page model substitution stops here;
- a source-faithful control must not force the predominantly visual tableau into a text-only validity criterion;
- the minimum source-faithful image observation record that exposes useful relations without importing a Tarot ontology;
- the first machine-readable textual subset large and diverse enough to begin blind semantic/relational discovery without overrepresenting one historical school;
- language normalization remains a separate transformation and must not erase source-owned distinctions;
- the Platonic Tarot card remains a target of discovery, not an input schema.
