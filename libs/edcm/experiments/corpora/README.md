# Real-system corpus evidence

This tree stores Git-safe aggregate reports and completion or incompletion
receipts. Raw corpus archives, extracted text, and resumable checkpoints do not
belong here.

## Usage guidance

Run a corpus only through its admitted source-native adapter. Store:

- aggregate reports under `results/`;
- completion or incompletion receipts under `receipts/`; and
- raw archives and checkpoints outside Git.

Every complete receipt must reconcile the full admitted source. A sample,
partition-only run, source mismatch, adapter failure, or interrupted execution
is `incomplete` and must retain its exact stopping point and reason.

## Historical runs and supersession

| Corpus | Dialogues | Turns | Status | Report | Receipt |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| MultiWOZ 2.1 | 10,438 | 143,048 | complete; current profile-0.2 evidence | [`2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin-rerun.json`](results/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin-rerun.json) | [`2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin-complete.json`](receipts/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin-complete.json) |
| MultiWOZ 2.1 | 10,438 | 143,048 | execution complete; profile interpretation superseded | [`2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-full.json`](results/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-full.json) | [`2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-complete.json`](receipts/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-complete.json) |

The MultiWOZ report was produced by
`edcm@6279d2236256f11866250011d15bf7080e4d9025` with
`ucns@eb264fba18bd051c46b4853c81c8fb91ec6d5811`. Its report digest is
`0bf4eb5c9ddf67fd6f48c766ce874435f63be10a32335882a0170be95eb98b21`.
An immediate completed-checkpoint rerun produced byte-identical report and
receipt files.

The old files remain immutable because they prove what profile 0.1 executed.
They are not current profile evidence: `4,094` tab, newline, and non-breaking
space occurrences were reported as out-of-alphabet even though they are SPACE
manifestations assigned to carrier position zero. The machine-readable
[supersession record](supersessions/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin.json)
preserves the exact old identities and links the clean profile-0.2 replacement.
The replacement assigns all `4,094` affected source occurrences to SPACE:
carrier-unassigned occurrences fall from `4,094` to `0`, SPACE boundaries rise
from `1,779,585` to `1,783,679`, and the source-dialogue and exact-turn digest
chains remain unchanged.

## Booking-outcome holdout

The 2026-08-02 derived experiment binds the merged UCNS v0.19 full-corpus seal
and evaluates externally authored `Booking-Book` / `Booking-NoBook` outcome
events without committing raw source text.

| Events | Status | Report | Receipt |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 6,531 | complete; candidate-measured holdout evidence | [`2026-08-02-multiwoz-2.1-booking-outcome-holdout-v0.1.0.json`](results/2026-08-02-multiwoz-2.1-booking-outcome-holdout-v0.1.0.json) | [`2026-08-02-multiwoz-2.1-booking-outcome-holdout-v0.1.0-complete.json`](receipts/2026-08-02-multiwoz-2.1-booking-outcome-holdout-v0.1.0-complete.json) |

Development has 5,214 included events, validation 656, and sealed test 661.
Nineteen development events containing both source labels are excluded and
counted. Test sensitivity is `0.4698`, specificity `0.5725`, balanced accuracy
`0.5212`, and ten-bin ECE `0.0047`. The sensitivity hypothesis is falsified.
A complete repeat produced byte-identical report and receipt files.

This derived measurement does not rewrite the represented-evidence profile
seal. UCNS supplies exact observation provenance only; formal geometry,
higher-gonol composition, measurement validity, production activation, and
canon selection remain absent.

## hmmm

The SPACE-origin classification is sealed represented evidence, and the
booking-outcome run is bounded candidate-measured evidence; neither is an EDCM
measurement-validity or formal-geometry claim. Only MultiWOZ 2.1 has an
admitted executable adapter in this tree. The remaining six sources require
their own license/privacy review, immutable source identity, source-native
adapter, and full-run reconciliation before admission.
