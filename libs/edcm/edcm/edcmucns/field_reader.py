"""Field reader for edcmucns v0.3.1.

Field state needs its own hash chain: ``field_scope`` in the readout registry
reads the ``ConstraintField`` / ``FieldMotion`` hash chain, and
:class:`edcm.edcmucns.Window` carries it as ``field_chain``. This module reads
an ordered sequence of :class:`edcm.ucns_objects.ConstraintField` states into
that chain — interleaving each field's ``field_hash`` with the
``prev -> curr`` transition hash of the :class:`FieldMotion` between
consecutive fields — and exposes the NA-safe F/E/O_scope motion readouts and
R/D/I/L_resistance state readouts the fields already produce.

Architecture only. The reader constructs and reports geometry and state; it
makes no empirical operating-state claim. Contact convergence over the chain
remains the frontier gate in :mod:`edcm.edcmucns.equivalence`; NA never
collapses to 0 (empty fields and absent motion stay NA).
