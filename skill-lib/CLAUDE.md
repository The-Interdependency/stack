# CLAUDE.md — skill-lib

AI-assistant guidance for `The-Interdependency/skill-lib`.

## Core facts

- `skill-lib` is the canonical organization-wide source for reusable agent skills.
- Other The Interdependency repos vendor repo-local copies from here.
- Edit skills here first; propagate later with the source commit SHA.
- License: MPL-2.0 (relicensed from MIT; weak/file-level copyleft — embed anywhere, changes to these files must be published).
- Entry points: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `skills.json`, `ORG_DISTRIBUTION.md`, `llms.txt`, each `<skill>/SKILL.md`.
- CI workflows: `.github/workflows/hygiene.yml` guards against tracked Python bytecode, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the editorial/helper verification stack, and `.github/workflows/consumer-drift.yml` is a scheduled/dispatch detector that runs `tools/check_consumer_drift.py` against each consumer repo (the consumer repos are public, so it uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
- Validation here is editorial plus pure-stdlib helper scripts in `tools/`, `ratios/`, `llms/`, and the RepoLOTO check module.
- The `llms/` package exists only to expose the stdlib `python -m llms.build` runner for `llms-build`.

## Skills

| Skill | Kind | Depends on | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `msdmd/` | metadata-block | — | Foundational convention. Defines the comment-block syntax, the parser contract, the runner protocol, reserved field names, and the visible gap-reporting requirement. Ships reference parsers under `msdmd/parsers/`. Every metadata-block skill builds on it. |
| `doc-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Self-declaring documentation coverage. Modules declare `# === DOCS ===` blocks; a runner verifies documentation paths/anchors and reports stale docs plus visible gaps. |
| `cap-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Self-declaring capability inventory. Modules declare `# === CAPABILITIES ===` blocks; a runner builds a capability map and verifies exposed surfaces. |
| `deps-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Self-declaring dependency topology. Modules declare `# === DEPENDENCIES ===` blocks; a runner builds import/call/capability graphs and reports unresolved edges, cycles, and visible gaps. |
| `owner-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd`, `risk-boundary-build` | Self-declaring module stewardship. Modules declare `# === OWNERS ===` blocks; a runner reports unowned modules, unresolved owners, and review coverage gaps. |
| `test-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Self-declaring contract evidence. Source modules declare behavior obligations in `# === CONTRACTS ===`; test modules declare executable witnesses in `# === CHECKS ===`; audit reconciles the witness list against the obligation list. |
| `meta-module-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Metadata-first module scaffolding. Each module declares a `# === MODULE_BUILD ===` block (manifest: surfaces, boundaries, tests, rollout, rollback) before implementation. New module work in any org repo is expected to start here. |
| `risk-boundary-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd`, `meta-module-build` | Runtime risk and permission boundaries. Existing modules declare `# === BOUNDARIES ===` blocks for auth, storage, network, user-data, admin, and operational effects. |
| `ratios/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Self-declaring module composition ratios for executable source files. Each module records `loc_comments`, `imports_exports`, and `calls_definitions` in a single `ratios:` line on the file's first and last line (not a fenced block); this is not for `json` or `.md` files. The reference `ratios_check.py` recomputes values, fails on drift or misplacement, and reports visible gaps. |
| `manifest/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Living-spec generator. Derives observable repo facts from `pyproject.toml` + the file tree and splices them into a machine-owned marked block in `CLAUDE.md`, with a CI `--check` drift gate. |
| `llms-build/` | metadata-block | `msdmd` | Root LLM instruction generation. Modules or central files declare `# === LLMS ===` blocks; `python -m llms.build` aggregates them into canonical root `llms.txt` and reports drift. |
| `typed-meta-frontend/` | metadata-block | `msdmd`, `meta-module-build`, `doc-build` | TypeScript self-building frontend generation from backend-owned module metadata. Modules declare `# === FRONTEND_META ===` blocks or equivalent backend metadata; the UI renders every module living spec, exposes every editable field, preserves read-only reasons and `hmmm`, and tests metadata-to-field coverage. |
| `canon/` | procedural | — | Canonical-source and doctrine maintenance. Helps agents distinguish source-backed canon, proposed canon, repo-local practice, and `hmmm`. No metadata block. |
| `domain-claims/` | procedural | — | Domain-first lexical and semantic governance. Establishes the domain-qualified sense, scope, exclusions, collision result, and standing that must precede a canonical definition, conversational provenance, or structural encoding. No metadata block. |
| `visitor-intro/` | procedural | — | Onboarding tour. Lets any agent give a coherent, repo-aware orientation to newcomers at any org repo without inventing org-level facts. No metadata block. |
| `char-compress/` | procedural | — | Unit Circle Number System-derived bone/flesh context compression. Carry flesh, frozen bones, transforms, and `hmmm`; drop only safely regenerable scaffold. Do not claim unearned theorem/status support or edcmbone metric status. |
| `agent-instantiation/` | procedural | — | a0/a0ucns agent lifecycle methodology. Spawn sub-agents via the `sub_agent_spawn` tool → spawn executor; fork/merge `PCNAEngine` instances via `InstanceMerge` (fork/absorb/converge); compose identities per the canonical `username(a0(energy)auditor)` grammar; honor spawn caps + write-route gating. Canonical source is `a0`; `a0-betatest` diverged (per-user native-ZFAE) and is out of scope. Repo-specific runtime doctrine (no theorem transfer). |
| `a0p-instancing/` | procedural | — | Peer for a0-betatest (a0p): agents are per-user CRUD `AgentInstance` + `CharacterSheet`, each owning a trained native ZFAE weight bank (three 157-seed cores); no `sub_agent_spawn`/executor/`InstanceMerge` — only volatile `MemoryCore.spawn_sub/merge_sub`. Sequence: create→distill-train→readiness gate→mode inference→sentinel/pending-override→safetensors checkpoint. Canonical source is `a0-betatest`. |
| `plain-lens/` | procedural | — | Plain-language, multi-lens companion views of dense canonical text. Build easier on-ramps (domain/audience/role lens selectors, progressive disclosure) that never replace or talk down to the source, keep a static fallback under any dynamic layer, preserve operators/negations/quantifiers, and report an EDCM-style body-vs-footnote tension reading as an illustrative heuristic (not an edcmbone metric runtime). |
| `gonol-build/` | procedural | — | UCNS gonol construction discipline. Resolve current UCNS authority; preserve intrinsic relations, closure, atomic promotion, occurrence identity, explicit punctuation-function plans, full-source receipts, and independent replay. Refuses superseded omega/phi/psi, bone/flesh, and carrier-LCM language doctrine. |
| `ucns-option-selection/` | procedural | — | Fail-closed scoped UCNS option selection. Freezes candidates, authority, gates, evidence, and policies; requires complete evaluation, replay, purpose-relative comparison, explicit ratification, rollback, and non-transfer. Hard-gate failures cannot be compensated by scores. |
| `meta/` | procedural | — | Meta Energy Theory axioms. Extract and preserve Energy Theory axioms from resonances among small network architectures, with formula-backed examples and overlap grids; keep Energy Theory distinct from EDCMBONE flesh/bone and FLAR implementation detail. |
| `the-interdependency/` | procedural | — | Workflow protocol for The Interdependency org: code/research/GitHub maintenance, EDCMBONE transcript assembly and analysis, and mandatory usage-guidance + structure-preservation doctrine across artifacts. |
| `interdependent-work-graph/` | procedural | — | Cross-repository coordination. Resolves exact participant identities, authority roles, relations, non-transfer boundaries, shared graph manifests, and validation/materialization order before selecting edit locations. Related doctrine: `the-interdependency`, `canon`. |
| `distributed-publication/` | procedural | — | Provenance-bearing publication from distributed source owners. Preserves exact source identities, source-local licenses and statuses, correction routing, fail-closed retrieval, explicit fallback, and publication build provenance. Loads with `interdependent-work-graph`. |
| `loop-eng/` | procedural | — | Loop engineering doctrine for closed feedback cycles (Discover→Plan→Execute→Verify→Iterate), maker/checker subagent separation, and autonomous verify-iterate workflows integrated with a0p/AIMMH and EDCMBONE Verify stages. |
| `action-calibration/` | procedural | — | Action sizing and escalation doctrine for choosing a smallest decisive experiment, maximal coherent program, prerequisite repair, or containment after preflighting scarce resources. |
| `skill-build/` | procedural | — | Skill authoring and compliance workflow. Provides the required question set for creating/revising skills, choosing metadata-block vs procedural shape, designing individualized skill test suites, and bringing existing skills into compliance. |
| `skill-usage/` | procedural | — | Evidence-bearing local usage maturity. Counts material invocations, preserves unobserved outcomes as `hmmm`, and separates nominal exposure thresholds from quality-capped effective maturity. |
| `ssh-automation/` | procedural | — | Fail-closed SSH automation and copy-paste delivery. Preserves verified endpoint identity, explicit authentication, local/remote shell and stdin boundaries, bounded retries, idempotent activation and rollback, and child-shell containment for bulk terminal pastes. |
| `vm-mcp/` | procedural | — | Private VM MCP control-plane doctrine. Keeps SSH credentials outside the model path, starts loopback-only and non-root, proves read-only contact first, and exposes privileged actions only as named bounded capabilities. |
| `sql-queries/` | procedural | — | Correct, performant SQL across major warehouse dialects (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, PostgreSQL): dialect reference, CTE/window patterns, optimization, debugging checklist. Imported from `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins` (Apache-2.0); see `ATTRIBUTION.md`. |
| `statistical-analysis/` | procedural | — | Statistical methods for analyses: descriptive stats, assumption checks, hypothesis testing, outlier detection, effect sizes, and plain-language interpretation. Imported from `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins` (Apache-2.0); see `ATTRIBUTION.md`. |
| `explore-data/` | procedural | — | Dataset profiling: shape, grain, null/duplicate/quality checks, distributions, and which dimensions and metrics merit analysis. Imported from `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins` (Apache-2.0); see `ATTRIBUTION.md`. |
| `validate-data/` | procedural | — | Pre-share QA of analyses: methodology, accuracy, and bias checks; reproduce key numbers independently; attack conclusions before sign-off. Imported from `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins` (Apache-2.0); see `ATTRIBUTION.md`. |
| `data-visualization/` | procedural | — | Effective chart-building doctrine with Python (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly): chart-type selection, honest encoding, accessibility. Imported from `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins` (Apache-2.0); see `ATTRIBUTION.md`. |

## Anatomy of a skill

Every skill is a directory at the repo root containing **at least a `SKILL.md`**. Optional
supporting files (parsers, executors, examples) live alongside it. Repo-level helper packages may
also exist when a skill exposes a module command, as `llms-build` does with `llms/build.py`.

### SKILL.md frontmatter

`SKILL.md` opens with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <slug>
description: <load-bearing trigger paragraph>
---
```

The `description` is the loading contract. Keep it specific. List triggers. Do not bury operative conditions in prose.

Two kinds:

- **Metadata-block skills** apply the msdmd convention to a named block (`DOCS`, `CAPABILITIES`, `DEPENDENCIES`, `OWNERS`, `CONTRACTS`,
  `CHECKS`, `MODULE_BUILD`, `BOUNDARIES`, `RATIOS`, `MANIFEST`, `LLMS`, `FRONTEND_META`, …). They define a field schema, a thin executor that consumes parsed
  entries, and a runner that emits a visible gap list. `test-build/` is the canonical worked
  example; `doc-build/`, `cap-build/`, `deps-build/`, `owner-build/`,
  `risk-boundary-build/`, `ratios/`, `manifest/`, `llms-build/`, and `typed-meta-frontend/` define adjacent applications. `msdmd` itself is the foundation.
- **Procedural skills** define an agent behaviour with no msdmd block. They state the doctrine
  they enforce and the output shape they produce. `canon/`, `domain-claims/`, `visitor-intro/`, `char-compress/`, `agent-instantiation/`, `a0p-instancing/`, `plain-lens/`, `gonol-build/`, `ucns-option-selection/`, `meta/`, `the-interdependency/`, `interdependent-work-graph/`, `loop-eng/`, `action-calibration/`, `skill-build/`, `skill-usage/`, `ssh-automation/`, `vm-mcp/`, `sql-queries/`, `statistical-analysis/`, `explore-data/`, `validate-data/`, `data-visualization/` are the examples.

## msdmd block syntax

```python
# === <BLOCK_NAME> ===
# id: <unique_snake_case_id>
#   <field>: <value>
#   <field>: <value>
# === END <BLOCK_NAME> ===
```

- The comment marker (`#`, `//`, `--`) is whatever is idiomatic for the file's language; the
  fence text and field structure are identical across languages.
- `BLOCK_NAME` is uppercase snake case. Every entry begins with `id:` (unique within the block,
  stable across refactors). Field lines are indented one level beneath the id.
- A file may contain multiple blocks of the same or different types; parsers concatenate entries.
- See `msdmd/SKILL.md` for the authoritative spec, reserved field names, and runner protocol.

### The reference parsers (`msdmd/parsers/`)

| File | Public API | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `universal.py` | `parse_text(text, block_name, marker="#")`, `parse_file(path, block_name)`, `walk_tree(root, block_name, *, skip=None, extensions=None)`, `marker_for(path)` | Pure Python stdlib. `walk_tree` returns `(annotated, untested)` so coverage gaps stay observable. |
| `universal.ts` | `parseText`, `parseFile`, `walkTree`, `markerFor`, `Entry`, `WalkOptions` | Pure Node stdlib (`node:fs`, `node:path`). TypeScript counterpart. |
| `__init__.py` | — | Package marker / docstring. |

`msdmd/collection.ts` defines the TypeScript shapes for generated repo-level
`<reponame>_msdmd.ts` collection points. `msdmd/collect.py` is a stdlib
generator prototype that emits that shape from parsed module-local blocks.
`msdmd/visualize.py` renders a minimal Mermaid graph from JSON or generated
TypeScript collection points.

Both parsers commit to **zero non-stdlib dependencies** and auto-detect the comment marker by
file extension. They are designed to be copied verbatim into any consuming project. A parser is
a pure function over file text: it returns all entries from all matching blocks, does not
interpret field semantics (that is the executor's job), and returns an empty list for files
with no block of the requested type.

Flesh to preserve:

- comment marker is language-idiomatic;
- fence text and field structure are identical across languages;
- `BLOCK_NAME` is uppercase snake case;
- every entry begins with stable `id:`;
- field lines are indented beneath the id;
- files may contain multiple blocks;
- parsers concatenate matching entries;
- unknown fields stay visible as `hmmm` where the skill requires it.

Reference parsers:

```text
msdmd/parsers/universal.py  # Python stdlib
msdmd/parsers/universal.ts  # Node stdlib
```

Parser contract:

- pure functions over file text;
- no non-stdlib dependencies;
- auto-detect comment marker by extension;
- return entries, not interpreted semantics;
- return empty list when no matching block exists;
- runners must report gap lists visibly.

## llms-build runner

`llms-build/SKILL.md` defines the `LLMS` metadata block. The reference command is:

```bash
python -m llms.build --root . --out llms.txt
python -m llms.build --root . --out llms.txt --apply
python -m llms.build --root . --out llms.txt --check
```

The runner lives in `llms/build.py`. It parses `LLMS` blocks, ignores Markdown fenced-code examples,
generates the canonical root `llms.txt`, and reports drift in `--check` mode. Edit source `LLMS`
blocks first; do not hand-edit `llms.txt` as independent doctrine.

## Maintenance tools

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python tools/check_skill_lib_drift.py
python tools/check_skill_compliance.py
python ratios/ratios_check.py --strict
python -m llms.build --root . --out llms.txt --check
python tests/test_repo_loto.py --audit
python tests/test_repo_loto.py
python tools/char_compress_check.py
python tools/propagate_skills.py ../target-repo          # dry-run
python tools/propagate_skills.py ../target-repo --apply  # local copy
python tools/check_consumer_drift.py ../target-repo --sha <sha>  # detect vendored-copy drift
```

Tool boundaries:

There is a small stdlib Python editorial test suite. There is still no `package.json`,
`pyproject.toml`, or `Makefile`. Do not invent commands beyond the checks that exist here.

- Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests` to validate skill registration,
  skills.json semantics, per-skill spec coverage, SKILL.md frontmatter, README
  index coverage, collection-point schema/generator/visualizer coverage, universal parser
  behavior, llms-build behavior, and parser ratio bookends.
- The parsers are reference implementations; the test suite covers core parser
  behavior and library integration, not every consuming-runner contract.
- `check_skill_lib_drift.py` checks editorial agreement among skill directories, `skills.json`, `README.md`, `ORG_DISTRIBUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and generated `llms.txt`.
- `check_skill_compliance.py` checks baseline `skill-build` invariants for each `SKILL.md`.
- `ratios_check.py --strict` verifies first/last ratios seals for covered executable source files.
- `tests/test_repo_loto.py --audit` reconciles RepoLOTO source `CONTRACTS` against test `CHECKS`; `tests/test_repo_loto.py` executes those checks.
- `char_compress_check.py` runs preservation fixtures from `char-compress/fixtures.json`; it is not the full Unit Circle Number System compression engine.
- `propagate_skills.py` copies canonical skill directories into a checked-out target repo, and carries any shared `doctrine/<file>` docs the propagated skills link to into `.agents/skills/doctrine/`; it does not commit, push, open pull requests, or contact GitHub.
- `check_consumer_drift.py` is the read-only counterpart: given a checked-out consumer repo it auto-detects the vendored skill subset and reports canonical-file drift, stale `manifest/generate.py.sha256` pins, missing/stale referenced `doctrine/<file>` docs, and (with `--sha`) a missing README source-commit citation. The scheduled `consumer-drift.yml` workflow runs it against every consumer repo; the consumer repos are public, so it uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- Runner sections in application SKILLs are contracts or patterns for *consuming* repos to
  implement against their own source trees, not scripts that live or run here unless the skill
  directory includes a helper file or package module.
- Validation here is editorial: keep `SKILL.md` frontmatter accurate, keep `skills.json` and the
  README table in sync with the directories present, keep generated files in sync with declarations,
  and keep the parsers/runners stdlib-only.

## Consumption and propagation

- Canonical install path inside consuming repos: `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`.
- Other paths may work only if the harness walks them.
- Copy skill directories verbatim.
- Add or preserve a target `.agents/skills/README.md` citing this repo and source commit SHA.
- Repo-local copies are never the source of truth.
- Target repos are listed in `ORG_DISTRIBUTION.md`.

## Editing doctrine

1. Edit here first.
2. Keep `skills.json`, `README.md`, `ORG_DISTRIBUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and generated `llms.txt` synchronized when adding, renaming, or removing a skill.
3. Preserve load-bearing descriptions.
4. Mark unknowns as `hmmm`; do not guess.
5. New module work in consuming repos should start with `MODULE_BUILD`.
6. Source modules own `CONTRACTS`; test modules own `CHECKS`; do not put test `call:` topology in source contracts.
7. Do not fork parser dialects; propose an `msdmd` extension instead.
8. Do not invent undeclared package/build commands for this repo.
9. Apply `char-compress` when compressing repo context: carry flesh, frozen bones, transforms, and hmmm; drop only safely regenerable scaffold.
10. Treat `char-compress` as Unit Circle Number System-derived compression doctrine, but do not claim unearned theorem/status support or edcmbone metric status.
11. Before promoting a word into canon, a theorem term, ontology primitive, schema field, encoding label, or cross-domain mapping, apply `domain-claims`: establish the domain-qualified sense and resolve collisions before attaching provenance; then apply `canon` to assess authority.
12. Before constructing, reviewing, replaying, or extending UCNS gonols, apply `gonol-build`: resolve current UCNS authority, preserve closure and atomic promotion, require explicit occurrence-addressed function plans, and keep incomplete constructors visible as `hmmm`.
13. Before selecting among UCNS options, apply `ucns-option-selection`: freeze the scoped decision boundary, enforce noncompensable eligibility and evidence gates, require explicit ratification, and preserve non-transfer, rollback, negative evidence, and `hmmm`.
14. For LLM instructions, edit `LLMS` source blocks and regenerate `llms.txt` with `python -m llms.build --root . --out llms.txt --apply`.
15. For SSH automation and large terminal pastes containing SSH, apply `ssh-automation`: verify endpoint identity and host trust, preserve local and remote interpreter boundaries, make retries and rollback explicit, and contain option/trap/exit effects inside a child shell.

## hmmm

- propagation still requires review, commit, and pull request work in target repos
- `char_compress_check.py` is deterministic fixture support, not the full Unit Circle Number System compression engine
- provider-specific SSH wrappers must be rechecked against their current evaluated configuration rather than assumed to preserve OpenSSH defaults
