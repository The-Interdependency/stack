# deps-build — Dependency topology on msdmd

`deps-build` is an application of [msdmd](../msdmd/SKILL.md). It makes
source-owned dependency edges and otherwise unexpressed architectural intent
inspectable without demanding a second declaration of existing imports.

Implementation status: this skill defines the `DEPENDENCIES` block and runner
contract. The MSDMD schema-2 collector ships Python import, `package.json`, and
`pyproject.toml` dependency extraction, but no complete resolution/cycle runner;
consuming repos implement and test local resolvers and policies.

Read `msdmd/SKILL.md` first. Its provenance, information-coverage, parser and
explicit reader-support contracts apply.

## Native-first coverage

Consume imports, package manifests, lockfiles, workspace/build declarations and
other supported dependency conventions at their owning scopes. Package metadata
stays package-owned; it is not copied into every source module. Preserve runtime,
build, development, optional and resolved-dependency distinctions and conditions.

An import is not a call edge or a complete architecture explanation. A lockfile
records a resolution, not every source-level usage. Collect the native edge as
expressed; supplement missing intent only where policy actually requires it.
Unsupported discovery/resolution remains `PENDING` / `hmmm`, not absent metadata.
Reader support beyond the shipped subsets remains implementation work.

## The block

Supplement otherwise unexpressed dependency intent:

```python
# === DEPENDENCIES ===
# id: chat_route_dependency_edges
#   summary: chat API route depends on auth context and chat repository
#   imports: auth.user_context, repositories.chat
#   calls: ChatRepository.get_by_owner
#   requires: auth_user_context, chat_repository
#   class: runtime
# === END DEPENDENCIES ===
```

## Field schema

These fields govern supplemental DEPENDENCIES entries, not native syntax.
Required:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable dependency declaration id. |
| `summary` | One-sentence description of why these edges exist. |

At least one edge field is required unless the entry records `hmmm`:

| Edge field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `imports` | Comma-separated modules/packages imported by this module. |
| `calls` | Comma-separated functions, methods, routes, commands, or capabilities called by this module. |
| `requires` | Comma-separated msdmd ids this module depends on. |
| `provides` | Comma-separated ids or surfaces this module provides to others. |
| `external` | Comma-separated external services, APIs, or packages this module depends on. |

Optional:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `class` | Dependency class (`runtime`, `build`, `test`, `docs`, `ops`, `agent`). |
| `direction` | `inbound`, `outbound`, `bidirectional`, or `hmmm`. |
| `owner` | Person, role, or team responsible for this dependency shape. |
| `since` | Version or date the declaration was added. |
| `deprecated` | If present, marks an edge scheduled for removal. |

## Runner contract

A DEPENDENCIES runner MUST:

1. Extract supported native dependencies and parse supplemental `DEPENDENCIES`
   blocks with the universal msdmd parser; report reader coverage.
2. Build source-qualified, typed edges from native declarations and `imports`,
   `calls`, `requires`, `provides` and `external` fields where resolvers exist.
3. Report failed capable resolution as drift; report unavailable resolvers,
   conditions or mappings as unresolved coverage, not proven broken dependencies.
4. Report cycles only in edge classes/configurations where local policy forbids them.
5. Report information GAPs only after capable inspection finds required edge or
   intent information absent. Block presence is a separate adoption measure.
6. Exit non-zero for malformed fields, failed resolvable edges or forbidden
   cycles; strict mode also fails on missing or unresolved required information.

## Reporting shape

- `EDGE`: declared/observed edge, kind, conditions and source scope.
- `UNRESOLVED`: an edge cannot be resolved, with a reason distinguishing drift from missing support.
- `CYCLE`: graph cycle detected under a stated configuration and policy.
- `PENDING`: edge, direction, mapping or reader recorded as `hmmm`.
- `GAP`: required dependency information is absent after capable inspection.

The generic block collector is not this graph runner and does not supply its
qualified-edge identity guarantees; see MSDMD's helper limitations.

## Validation

A native-import plus manifest fixture with zero DEPENDENCIES blocks must retain
source-level and package-level edges separately. Include optional dependencies,
unknown build conditions, genuinely missing intent and permitted/forbidden cycles.

## Anti-patterns

- Treating an import list as a complete architecture explanation or call graph.
- Requiring module-local duplicates of package-owned dependencies.
- Hiding unresolved dependencies by omitting them; use `hmmm`.
- Failing all cycles blindly; some test or plugin graphs may intentionally cycle.

hmmm
- exact resolver syntax for cross-language call and route edges
- which dependency classes disallow cycles by default
- cross-language resolution and application cycle policy remain consuming-runner work
