# cap-build — Capability declarations on msdmd

`cap-build` is an application of [msdmd](../msdmd/SKILL.md). It gives
agents and humans a source-backed inventory of declared capabilities, exposed
surfaces and the boundaries they are declared to cross.

Implementation status: this skill defines the `CAPABILITIES` block and runner
contract. The MSDMD schema-2 collector ships a Python callable/class/export
reader, but no complete behavioral capability or framework/API-schema runner;
consuming repos implement and test their remaining mappings.

Read `msdmd/SKILL.md` first. Its provenance, information-coverage, parser and
explicit reader-support contracts apply.

## Native-first coverage

Consume signatures, exports, annotations, interface declarations and API schemas
at their owning scopes. A supported native declaration needs no duplicate
CAPABILITIES block. Preserve overloads, conditions and qualified symbol identity.
A signature establishes a declared surface, not a full behavioral capability;
missing behavioral intent may still require a supplemental declaration.

Keep syntactically observed surfaces, documented behavior, derived mappings and
verified outcomes distinct. Unsupported surface discovery is `PENDING`, not
proof of either complete coverage or an absent capability. Reader support beyond
the shipped source/standard subsets remains implementation work.

## The block

Supplement otherwise unexpressed capability intent:

```python
# === CAPABILITIES ===
# id: agent_supervisor_dynamic_spawn
#   summary: spawns child agents under a bounded supervisor
#   exposes: AgentSupervisor.start_child/1
#   inputs: child_spec
#   outputs: supervisor_child_ref
#   boundaries: auth:none, storage:none, network:none, user_data:none
#   owner: runtime-platform
# === END CAPABILITIES ===
```

## Field schema

These fields govern supplemental CAPABILITIES entries, not native syntax.
Required:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable capability id. |
| `summary` | One-sentence capability description. |
| `exposes` | Function, class, route, command, UI component, or other public surface that exposes the capability; use `hmmm` if unresolved. |

Optional:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `inputs` | Comma-separated input names or shapes. |
| `outputs` | Comma-separated output names or shapes. |
| `boundaries` | Comma-separated `name:value` boundary summary (`auth:none`, `storage:read`, etc.). Use `hmmm` for unresolved values. |
| `requires` | Comma-separated capability or module ids this capability depends on. |
| `class` | Free-text capability class (`runtime`, `ui`, `data`, `agent`, `ops`). |
| `owner` | Person, role, or team responsible for the capability. |
| `since` | Version or date the capability was added. |
| `deprecated` | If present, marks the capability as scheduled for removal. |

## Runner contract

A CAPABILITIES runner MUST:

1. Extract supported native surface metadata and parse supplemental
   `CAPABILITIES` blocks with the universal msdmd parser.
2. Build a source-qualified capability map; retain native and declared IDs.
3. Diagnose duplicate identities within their declared scope; identical names
   in different scopes do not establish the same capability.
4. Verify each non-`hmmm` `exposes` target with a capable language/framework
   resolver; report unsupported resolution rather than guessing success.
5. Report unresolved exposure, boundary information and required readers as pending.
6. Report an information GAP only when capable discovery and inspection find
   a required declaration absent. Do not equate missing blocks with missing capabilities.
7. Exit non-zero for malformed declarations, identity conflicts or broken
   resolvable targets; strict mode also fails on missing or unresolved required scope.

## Reporting shape

- `CAPABILITY`: qualified identity, summary, exposing module, owner and boundaries.
- `BROKEN_EXPOSES`: a declared surface fails a capable resolver.
- `DUPLICATE`: identity collides within its declared scope.
- `PENDING`: unresolved fields, mappings or extraction coverage.
- `GAP`: required capability information is absent after capable inspection.

The shipped generic block collector does not implement this capability runner's
qualified-identity or duplicate-validation contract; see MSDMD's helper limitations.

## Validation

A native-export/API-schema fixture must yield its declared surface without a
CAPABILITIES copy. It must not acquire invented behavior or verification.
Include same-name/different-scope, genuinely missing intent and unsupported-reader cases.

## Anti-patterns

- Requiring a module-local copy of capability metadata already in its native owner.
- Using implementation-shaped ids (`function_runs`) instead of capability-shaped ids (`agent_supervisor_dynamic_spawn`).
- Hiding boundary uncertainty; write `hmmm` where the effect is unresolved.
- Treating a module import as a capability without identifying the exposed behavior.

hmmm
- exact resolver syntax for framework-specific route and UI surfaces
- application capability identity and semantic conflict policy remain consuming-runner work
- whether private capabilities need a distinct class in the consuming policy
