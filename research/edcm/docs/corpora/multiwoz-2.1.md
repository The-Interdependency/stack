# MultiWOZ 2.1 full-corpus evidence run

**Status:** admitted; profile-0.2 sealed full-corpus rerun complete on
2026-07-28; profile-0.1 SPACE interpretation superseded; UCNS v0.14.1
completion-receipt rerun and exact v0.19-producer rerun sealed on 2026-07-31;
merged v0.19-integrity producer reseal completed on 2026-08-01.
**Evidence state:** current and historical represented evidence; no EDCM
candidate measurement or joint-canon selection.

## Preserved structure

The runner processes the University of Cambridge deposit identified by DOI
`10.17863/CAM.41572`. Admission is bound to the complete ZIP SHA-256 and the
byte count and SHA-256 of every logical archive member. The raw archive remains
outside Git.

`data.json` is streamed in its original top-level dialogue order. Within each
dialogue, every `log[*].text` value is passed without normalization to the exact
EDCM-only UCNS word-gonol consumer. After source-native reconciliation, the
runner independently repeats the authenticated turn stream through the UCNS
v0.14.1 full-corpus gate and requires its execution-generated receipt plus a
matching source-native turn chain. The runner does not sample, sort,
deduplicate, case-fold, normalize Unicode, fold whitespace, or flatten speaker
turns. Under profile 0.2, the pinned Unicode SPACE manifestations share carrier
position zero while their exact source values and code points remain separate
witnesses. Report and checkpoint profile identity bind the Unicode-scalar
source domain, all 25 ordered SPACE code points, and their canonical digest.

MultiWOZ does not carry an explicit speaker field in each log entry. The
adapter therefore declares its own convention:

```text
zero-based even log ordinal -> user
zero-based odd log ordinal  -> system
```

This convention is adapter provenance, not source truth. Goal objects, turn
metadata, dialogue acts, ontology, databases, and partition lists remain
source-native evidence and do not silently enter the word-gonol observation.

## Usage guidance

Keep the archive outside the repository and use a clean checkout of merged
UCNS v0.19 commit `a98c9e6c69804a8a08d0786b1d8b450bb2c49a97`, which includes the
final integrity repairs. The consumed profile remains version 0.2.0 and the
full-corpus completion schema remains version 0.14.1:

```bash
python edcm/corpora/run_multiwoz21_seal.py \
  --archive /path/to/MULTIWOZ2.1.zip \
  --ucns-source-root /path/to/ucns-at-a98c9e6c69804a8a08d0786b1d8b450bb2c49a97 \
  --output /tmp/multiwoz-2.1-ucns-v019.json \
  --receipt /tmp/multiwoz-2.1-ucns-v019-receipt.json \
  --checkpoint /tmp/multiwoz-2.1-ucns-v019.checkpoint.json
```

The runner refuses a dirty EDCM or UCNS tracked tree for a sealed run. It also
compares every EDCM package file directly with replacement-disabled `HEAD` and
verifies active-runtime EDCM caches, so index flags cannot hide executed-code
drift. Its directly executed source launcher establishes the trust boundary
before importing the corpus module, so a pre-existing module cache cannot
replace the bootstrap program. The launcher dispatches the seal to an isolated
fresh Python interpreter from a cache-free, replacement-disabled Git archive of
the sealed EDCM producer checkout. It removes inherited Git repository-selector
variables, resolves one exact commit and `edcm/`
tree, archives that exact commit, and passes the same tree identity into the
worker, so a concurrent `HEAD` change cannot relabel the executing snapshot.
That authenticated runner verifies the original worktree and its active caches,
then verifies the UCNS package tree and the exact active cache derived for each
source, including an external `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`, before its first import.
Already-loaded or pre-verification module code therefore cannot survive into
sealed execution. Worker mode is selected only by the authenticated extracted
snapshot context; no command-line flag can bypass the bootstrap. Bootstrap
identity, archive, or extraction failure writes an
incomplete receipt before exit. The child preserves the caller's working
directory, so relative command-line paths keep their documented meaning. A
checkpoint is written atomically at the selected interval and can resume only
when archive, admission, EDCM package tree, UCNS commit, and already-processed source
prefix all match.

Successful completion requires:

- all `10,438` dialogues;
- all source turns observed exactly once by the adapter;
- all `143,048` source turns consumed by the UCNS v0.14.1 gate;
- UCNS source and reconstructed-observation stream digests equal;
- the repeated UCNS-pass source-native turn chain equals the first pass;
- unit support equal to adapted turn count;
- exact `8,438 / 1,000 / 1,000` train/validation/test reconciliation;
- every validation and test identifier present; and
- valid source JSON through EOF.

Any failure produces an incomplete receipt containing the last completed
dialogue and the active dialogue/turn position when available. Reports,
receipts, and checkpoints contain no raw turn text.

The v1.0.0 admission manifest remains committed under its versioned filename so
the 2026-07-28 report and receipt digests stay reconstructable. The live v1.1.0
manifest adds the already observed `143,048`-turn expectation and the explicit
v0.14.1 adapter, privacy, redaction, and admission-decision bindings. It does
not rewrite the historical evidence.

## Output interpretation

Committed aggregate evidence includes source/archive identities, full
dialogue/turn reconciliation, chained exact-text identities, word and
carrier-SPACE totals, true non-SPACE out-of-alphabet code-point totals,
structural edge cases, and counts of source-declared nonempty `fail_book` and
`fail_info` goal mappings. Leading, trailing, and repeated SPACE metrics are
computed from `alphabet_position == 0`, not from raw equality with `U+0020`.

Those source annotations are not EDCM inferences. No correction, retraction,
refusal, unresolved-reference, diagnosis, intention, morality, consciousness,
or external-truth classifier is introduced by this runner.

The historical sealed run processed `10,438` dialogues and `143,048` turns.
Source turns, adapter turns, and profile unit support reconciled exactly; train,
validation, and test counts reconciled at `8,438 / 1,000 / 1,000`. Its immutable
[report](../../experiments/corpora/results/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-full.json)
and [completion receipt](../../experiments/corpora/receipts/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-complete.json)
remain provenance-bearing records.

That run classified `4,094` occurrences of `U+0009`, `U+000A`, and `U+00A0`
as out-of-alphabet. They are SPACE manifestations under the corrected profile
and belong at carrier position zero. Consequently the historical
out-of-alphabet, word-gonol, boundary, and leading/trailing/repeated SPACE
aggregates must not be presented as current profile-0.2 totals. The
[supersession record](../../experiments/corpora/supersessions/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin.json)
states the defect and links the complete sealed replacement
[report](../../experiments/corpora/results/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin-rerun.json)
and [receipt](../../experiments/corpora/receipts/2026-07-28-multiwoz-2.1-space-origin-complete.json).

The replacement ran from clean pushed commits
`edcm@fbee2ee57f765b47c362a6877521493cc1afe20a` and
`ucns@c799b3547afc91a6039a5d3b15f997426eed138a`. It preserved the exact archive,
dialogue count, turn count, partition counts, source-dialogue digest chain, and
turn-evidence digest chain. The corrected classification is:

| Observation | Profile 0.1 | Profile 0.2 | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Carrier-unassigned occurrences | 4,094 | 0 | -4,094 |
| SPACE boundaries | 1,779,585 | 1,783,679 | +4,094 |
| Word gonols | 1,882,845 | 1,885,785 | +2,940 |
| Leading-SPACE turns | 186 | 261 | +75 |
| Trailing-SPACE turns | 20,493 | 21,264 | +771 |
| Repeated-SPACE excess | 19,109 | 19,417 | +308 |

Thus all `4,094` disputed occurrences moved from carrier-unassigned evidence to
source-preserved SPACE boundaries; none disappeared or changed code-point
identity.

The historical replacement predates the UCNS v0.14.1 execution gate. Its
completion receipt remains valid for the EDCM v1.1 runner contract but cannot
be promoted into a v0.14.1 receipt. |∆|Only a fresh execution over the admitted
archive could create that receipt; the independently sealed execution below is
that new evidence.|∆|

## UCNS v0.14.1 sealed execution

The fresh run used clean EDCM merge commit
`2e667f648bfcfa9f067997eb7e56d2346a4ba30c` and exact UCNS commit
`868d80878c9ecd93ff30e91ca289122ded805a49`. It authenticated the admitted
archive and all 13 members, completed the EDCM pass, then independently replayed
all turns through the UCNS full-corpus executor. A checkpoint repeat produced
byte-identical artifacts.

The repeated UCNS-pass turn-evidence chain equals the source-native EDCM pass,
and the current failure-seeking aggregates equal the corrected 2026-07-28
profile-0.2 evidence. `canon_selection` remains null; EDCM and METAPAT
activation remain inactive.

exact profile observation != formal UCNS geometry

NA != 0
```

## UCNS v0.19 producer seal

After the v0.19 source-coordinate boundary reached clean review, EDCM repinned
the unchanged profile `0.2.0` and full-corpus gate `0.14.1` to exact UCNS commit
`872f53571d5dc2f133ff1813b7bdffd3a9c309f8`. Clean EDCM producer commit
`973d4b314ee7fbcd35b2e207b889faf7366c3814`, whose `edcm/` subtree is
`658767bc64936f152e19c2f1cebb9ae86c1932cb`, reran the admitted archive. A
completed-checkpoint repeat produced byte-identical artifacts.

Schema `1.3.0` seals the content-addressed Git tree for the executing `edcm/`
package rather than treating the intermediate producer commit as the durable
code identity. The same subtree is embedded unchanged in the evidence commit
and remains reachable after a squash merge; the producer commit is retained as
an audit coordinate but is not required to recover the executed package bytes.

- EDCM receipt digest: `feb7e98891cdb4baee521cc90c68a695922d9ce70d665678fa9e9ea3dde5f629`

The source dialogue chain, turn-evidence chain, execution counts, failure-seeking
aggregates, exact stream hash, and v0.14.1 gate receipt remain identical to the
prior sealed rerun. The EDCM report and receipt identities change because they
correctly bind the EDCM package tree and UCNS producer commit. UCNS v0.19's coordinate
candidate is evidenced only over its fixed full producer demonstration; this
corpus runner neither attaches nor consumes it. `canon_selection` remains null,
candidate measurement remains `not-run`, and EDCM/METAPAT remain inactive.

## Merged UCNS v0.19 integrity reseal

After UCNS merged the reviewed v0.19 line with the final integrity repairs at
`a98c9e6c69804a8a08d0786b1d8b450bb2c49a97`, EDCM repinned the unchanged
profile `0.2.0` and full-corpus gate `0.14.1`. Published EDCM producer commit
`7b93764377e92d4f2807170f58ba07535bb0c66c`, whose `edcm/` subtree is
`f55ca30e16e1d45fb3b0b94794615f672edbbde6`, reran the complete admitted
archive. A completed-checkpoint repeat produced byte-identical artifacts.

- partitions: `8,438 / 1,000 / 1,000` train/validation/test
- exact UCNS source/observation stream SHA-256: `e94ba2e5e1e9d52b23fd5b9c33303be009dae32f4c3bc6a1d5186a353acb40b5`
- UCNS receipt id: `921ceacad026de1d884eec3e049b090246014706c937c062bd32f40bbff01f0c`

- EDCM receipt digest: `c74abbfaed4a0c18b0296d6245d59b436ad74c1eebc3d1cdd6e092f48534ff65`

The source dialogue chain, turn-evidence chain, execution counts,
failure-seeking aggregates, exact stream hash, and UCNS v0.14.1 receipt id
remain identical to the prior v0.19 seal. Only the producer-bound EDCM and UCNS
identities rotate. The source-coordinate candidate is still not attached or
consumed; `canon_selection` remains null, candidate measurement remains
`not-run`, formal geometry remains `NA`, and EDCM/METAPAT remain inactive.

## Externally labelled booking-outcome holdout

The frozen 2026-08-02 design derives outcome events from source-native
`dialogue_acts.json` annotations. An event is positive for `Booking-Book` and
negative for `Booking-NoBook`. The labelled system response at log index
`2k-1`, later turns, dialogue acts, goals, metadata, ontology, and databases
remain outside candidate input. Exact source turns remain outside Git and are
bound only through aggregate digest chains.

Development fits a Platt map over the maintained terminal progress proxy;
validation selects one balanced-accuracy threshold; the test partition is
evaluated after the calibration digest freezes. Counts reconcile as:

| Partition | Positive | Negative | Ambiguous excluded |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| development | 4,164 | 1,050 | 19 |
| validation | 543 | 113 | 0 |
| test | 530 | 131 | 0 |

The test produced `TP=249`, `FP=56`, `FN=281`, and `TN=75`. Sensitivity is
`0.4698` (95% Wilson `0.4277–0.5124`); specificity is `0.5725` (`0.4869–0.6540`);
balanced accuracy is `0.5212` with a 2,000-replicate dialogue-cluster interval
of `0.4656–0.5739`. The declared sensitivity hypothesis is falsified. Low ECE
(`0.0047`) accompanies a very small fitted slope and does not establish useful
discrimination.

- [completion receipt](../../experiments/corpora/receipts/2026-08-02-multiwoz-2.1-booking-outcome-holdout-v0.1.0-complete.json)

A complete repeat produced byte-identical report and receipt files. This
derived report advances only the admitted outcome events to bounded
candidate-measured evidence. The underlying profile seal remains represented
evidence; formal geometry, higher-gonol composition, production activation,
measurement-validity transfer, and canon selection remain absent.

## hmmm

The corrected SPACE-origin totals and UCNS v0.14.1 execution receipt are sealed
represented evidence. The new receipt was earned by fresh execution rather than
inferred from the prior report. They are not formal Möbius geometry or an EDCM
measurement-validity claim. Source-native
labels for correction, retraction, refusal, and unresolved reference are not
complete in MultiWOZ 2.1 and remain unresolved rather than being guessed from
text. UCNS v0.19 supplies a nonselected trace-local source-coordinate candidate
over its fixed full producer demonstration, but this corpus runner does not
attach or consume it. Higher-gonol composition and lawful projection from exact
observations into EDCM scalar readouts remain open.
