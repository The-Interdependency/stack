# Subatomic Affixiation Baseline — hydrogen → helium (provisional candidate)

- Status: **CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS / provisional research candidate**
- Root impact: **none**
- Owner of record: `The-Interdependency/stack` → `research/epac/` placeholder (no canonical epac
  repository exists yet — see `STACK_MANIFEST.md`)
- Canon class: **proposed** — nothing in this document is org canon. Established facts are
  cited from current METAPAT and UCNS sources and marked `implemented`; everything else is
  candidate or `hmmm`.

## 1. Domain claims (before any definition)

Per `domain-claims`, the operative senses are claimed before the construction uses them.

| Surface form | Term id | Claiming domain | Claimed sense | Scope | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| hydrogen | `physics.atomic.hydrogen` | physics | element with atomic number Z=1 | empirical element identity | native | ratified in physics |
| hydrogen (here) | `epac.subatomic_affixiation.hydrogen` | epac candidate | declared participant set: one proton participant on declared carrier positions | this construction only | specialized | provisional |
| helium | `physics.atomic.helium` | physics | element with atomic number Z=2 | empirical element identity | native | ratified in physics |
| helium (here) | `epac.subatomic_affixiation.helium` | epac candidate | declared participant set: two proton + two neutron participants (default instance He-4) affixiated over the Möbius parameter | this construction only | specialized | provisional |
| lithium (here) | `epac.subatomic_affixiation.lithium` | epac candidate | same construction form at Z=3 (default instance Li-7) | program target | specialized | provisional |
| carbon (here) | `epac.subatomic_affixiation.carbon` | epac candidate | same construction form at Z=6 (default instance C-12) | program target | specialized | provisional |
| affixiation | `metapat.affixiation_harmonics.affixiation` | METAPAT | identity-preserving higher-order declared relation; participants stay addressable; may integrate as object-whole at a declared native scale | cross-domain application | borrowed (unchanged) | CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS (per METAPAT application) |
| carrier position | `ucns.public_gonol.position` | UCNS | exact glyph identity at exact index on the 157-position Public Gonol carrier | UCNS geometry | borrowed (unchanged) | implemented |
| derivation (here) | `epac.subatomic_affixiation.derivation` | epac candidate | replay of the same declared construction form for another element | this document | specialized | provisional |

**Collision check:** physics owns the empirical senses of hydrogen/helium/lithium/carbon; the
epac senses are explicitly scoped to this construction and do not contest physics. No prior
hydrogen/helium/lithium claims exist in current metapat or ucns checkouts. Resolution: **clear**
(separate scopes, no overlap).

## 2. METAPAT consultation

- question: what relation organizes the hydrogen → helium baseline over the UCNS carrier?
- METAPAT standing: **application** — `metapat.application.affixiation_harmonics`
  (CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS, root impact none); not axiom, postulate, or theorem.
- relevant relation: affixiation (identity-preserving higher-order relation), time-agnostic
  recurrence and oscillation, harmonic correspondence and resonance as candidate language.
- transfers: the shared question form only —

  ```text
  addressable participants
  -> declared relation
  -> declared ordered parameter or parameters
  -> recurrent structure
  -> harmonic correspondence or non-correspondence
  -> possible native-scale integration
  -> recursively addressable whole
  ```

- does not transfer: element identity or empirical facts (physics), carrier/containment/geometry
  selection (UCNS), geometric operation of carrier positions (UCNS `hmmm`), measurement validity
  (EDCM), physical frequency or temporal periodicity.
- downstream consequence: a named, bounded epac candidate may proceed with a declared admission
  profile, the Möbius turn index as the time-agnostic ordered parameter, and explicit `hmmm` on
  every position operation.

## 3. UCNS established baseline (implemented surfaces only)

Cited from current UCNS at `1975fe70`:

- **Public Gonol carrier** (`implemented`): exactly 157 one-scalar glyph positions in fixed order;
  digest `55d10c84529a4d7bc7714786357e977b68d9df2ac3f73d20e229580b552c2ef5`; every glyph is a
  function position; no linguistic subclassing.
- **Structural Null origin** (`implemented`): fixed origin at carrier position `0` (glyph `" "`),
  singular, not ordinary numeric zero.
- **Native Möbius root loop** (`implemented`): quotient `(t, ε) ~ (t + n, (-1)^n ε)` with exact
  rational turns. One visible turn (t=1) returns to the same phase with the local frame reversed;
  two visible turns (t=2) restore the complete state.
- **Position operations** (`hmmm`, declared in `ucns/src/ucns/public_gonol.py` MODULE_BUILD):
  "the exact geometric operation expressed by each function position beyond its carrier identity"
  is unresolved. No construction here may invent one.

## 4. Candidate construction (named, bounded, provisional)

### 4.1 Admission profile (epac-owned candidate, instance-resolved)

- Element `E(Z, A)` is represented by `Z` proton-participant positions and `A − Z`
  neutron-participant positions on the Public Gonol carrier.
- Default isotope instances are declared per element — H-1, He-4, Li-7, C-12. Isotope choice is
  **instance-resolved**, not a law of the construction.
- Proton participants occupy the first `Z` carrier positions after the origin: positions
  `1 .. Z`. Neutron participants occupy the next `A − Z` positions: positions `Z+1 .. A`.
- Every assigned position is an **identity coordinate only**. No geometric operation is asserted
  for any position.

### 4.2 Baseline: hydrogen → helium

```text
hydrogen (H-1): participants {p0 @ position 1}
    relation: none (single participant)
    closure: participant-scale whole

helium (He-4): participants {p0 @1, p1 @2} ∪ {n0 @3, n1 @4}
    declared relation: affixiation
    ordered parameter: Möbius turn index t ∈ {0, 1, 2}   (time-agnostic)
      t=0: simultaneous tensor arrangement of participants (tensor-first)
      t=1: visible 360° return — local frame flips (distinguishable relational state)
      t=2: complete 720° return — full framed state restored
    recurrence: frame flip/restore is the recurrent structure over parameter t
    closure: affixiated helium-whole at the declared atomic native scale;
             constituents remain addressable with identity and provenance
```

The only geometry used is the established Möbius framing. The carrier positions supply identity;
they do not yet supply operations. Hydrogen and helium differ by participant set and affixiation
arity — nothing else is claimed.

### 4.3 Derivation of lithium, carbon, et al. (same construction form)

```text
lithium (Li-7): p @1,2,3 ; n @4..7    -> affixiate -> Möbius recurrence -> atomic-scale closure
carbon  (C-12): p @1..6  ; n @7..12   -> affixiate -> Möbius recurrence -> atomic-scale closure
```

Each further element is a **separate candidate instance** of the same construction form. "Derive"
in this document means **replay the same declared construction** for a different declared
participant set. It does not mean a physics derivation, a UCNS theorem, a chemical fact, or a
proof that one element emerges from another.

### 4.4 Deterministic receipt (replay contract)

For each closed element-whole, a receipt is the SHA-256 over canonical JSON of:

```text
element_id, isotope_instance, ordered proton positions, ordered neutron positions,
relation_id ("affixiation"), ordered parameter ("ucns.native-mobius-turn-index"),
t-state sequence (0 -> 1 -> 2), closure_scale ("atomic"), source_commits
```

Independent replay must reproduce the receipt byte-for-byte. A receipt establishes
reproducibility of the declared construction only — not geometry, physics, or measurement.

## 5. What this establishes — and what it does not

**Established (proposed candidate):** a source-bound, replayable baseline that binds current
METAPAT affixiation semantics to current UCNS carrier identity surfaces, using the native Möbius
turn index as the time-agnostic ordered parameter.

**Not established:** any Public Gonol position operation; any geometry between carrier positions;
any harmonic notation or resonance coupling; any physics or chemistry claim; any EDCM measurement
projection; any canon promotion in METAPAT, UCNS, or elsewhere.

## 6. Usage guidance

To replay by hand:

1. Pin sources: METAPAT `34d954a`, UCNS `1975fe7` (recorded above and in `STACK_MANIFEST.md`).
2. Read `metapat/docs/applications/affixiation-harmonics.md` for the semantic definitions used.
3. Read `ucns/src/ucns/public_gonol.py` and `ucns/src/ucns/direct_mobius.py` for the carrier and
   Möbius surfaces used.
4. Apply the admission profile in §4.1, run the construction in §4.2/§4.3, and verify the receipt
   in §4.4 against an independent replay.

To implement later (only after UCNS establishes position operations, or as a pure identity-profile
consumer):

```text
entry points: ucns.public_gonol_function(index)  # carrier identity position
              ucns.native_mobius_state(turns)    # established Möbius framing
```

Do not add local geometry, position-operation semantics, or physics status inside this candidate.

## 7. Next decisive step (action-calibration)

- decision: is the H→He affixiation baseline a usable identity-level candidate for the epac program?
- minimal decisive action: an executable H→He candidate that consumes only the two UCNS public
  surfaces above, produces the §4.4 receipt, and is independently replayed byte-identically.
- positive outcome → escalate to Li/C instances of the same constructor.
- negative outcome → the admission profile or receipt contract needs repair before any Li/C work.
- unresolved outcome → UCNS position operations remain `hmmm`; keep identity-only scope.
- frozen stop condition: receipt mismatch or any invented position operation fails the candidate.

## 8. hmmm

- The geometric operation of every Public Gonol position beyond carrier identity remains unresolved
  (UCNS-owned `hmmm`); this baseline deliberately does not fill it.
- No UCNS harmonic-resonance notation is selected (METAPAT-owned `hmmm`); phase/ratio/coupling
  fields remain candidates.
- Isotope defaults (H-1, He-4, Li-7, C-12) are instance-resolved, not canonical admission law.
- epac has no canonical source repository; this record lives in the stack placeholder and must
  migrate if `The-Interdependency/epac` is created.
- No EDCM measurement projection is declared; nothing here may become empirical validation.
- Promotion of affixiation from application terminology into METAPAT postulates/theories remains
  unresolved and is not advanced by this candidate.

## 9. Local implementation status (2026-08-22)

The frozen minimal decisive action from §7 is now implemented locally (not pushed):

- `element_affixiation_candidate.py` — identity-only constructor for H/He/Li/C consuming only
  `ucns.public_gonol_function` and `ucns.native_mobius_state`. Carries `MODULE_BUILD` and
  `CONTRACTS` blocks; no position operation is defined or inferred.
- `test_element_affixiation_candidate.py` — five executable witnesses with a `CHECKS` block.
  Result: **5 passed** against the pinned UCNS snapshot package (`ucns/src` at `1975fe7`).
- `receipts/` — sealed construction receipts, one per element:

  | Element | Receipt (SHA-256) |
  |---|---|
  | H | `be411f204e10c14ac42b2983677f6b22a02d1cb6c4b158bf2026b0b6e88ca3da` |
  | He | `5d7d82a86bb59223495663cbf285310900fdad9499fb8b50f8fe355786a9edc7` |
  | Li | `5efefff19f97e4f42fa0d85d9719adbe07c39fc7dab700a5eea13f434611bb3f` |
  | C | `a4026f197d6a0425b4ea5b3ff72d09d49fd159d5f59440480b5f97793b64cdc6` |

- Independent replay (`replay_element`) is byte-identical for all four elements.
- Status remains `CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS / provisional`. Nothing here establishes position
  operations, geometry between positions, harmonic notation, physics, or canon.

## 10. Physically sourced harmonic candidates (2026-08-22)

Per METAPAT's evidence contract, harmonic candidates do **not** wait for a UCNS harmonic
notation. Each candidate declares participants, ordered parameter, recurrence mapping,
equivalence condition, information loss, and physical provenance. The ordered parameter is
the time-agnostic nucleon-content sequence `(A, Z)`, not time and not an unsourced phase.
No Public Gonol position operation is invented.

- `nuclear_harmonic_candidates.py` — five candidates with `MODULE_BUILD` + `CONTRACTS`.
- `test_nuclear_harmonic_candidates.py` — five witnesses with `CHECKS`. **10/10 tests pass**
  across both modules; CONTRACTS↔CHECKS audit **closed** (10 contracts / 10 checks).
- `receipts/harmonic_*.json` — sealed candidate records.

| Candidate | Kind | Li-7 | C-12 | Receipt |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| alpha-cluster recurrence | recurrence | recurs | recurs | `212fd1bf…e5ad` |
| N/Z ratio commensurability | ratio | no (4/3) | recurs (1) | `8a49097a…f030` |
| ground-state spin-parity symmetry | symmetry | no (3/2⁻) | recurs (0⁺) | `b0d5eded…dd77a` |
| binding-per-nucleon commensurability | commensurability | no (~21% dev) | recurs (~8% dev) | `6a888f65…54e9` |
| proton↔neutron inversion symmetry | inversion | no (N≠Z) | recurs (N=Z) | `9ac380f4…52f9` |

Surviving relation across Li and C: **only the alpha-cluster recurrence** survives both;
the four N=Z / even-even relations survive C-12 but not Li-7. Physical provenance for the
numeric nuclear data is web-pinned 2026-08-22; alpha-cluster and isospin citations remain
`hmmm` (standard references, exact citation not web-pinned this session). All results remain
`CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS / hmmm` — no physics validation or canon is claimed.

## 11. Subatomic gonol (2026-08-22)

The subatomic gonol closes one element gonol per symbol from three separately addressable
layers, using the EPAC Public Gonol constructor (`epac.public_gonol`) on the UCNS
Public Gonol carrier. This is not `edcm.gonol`:

1. **nucleus participant** — subatomic identity (proton/neutron Public Gonol carrier
   positions and glyphs, Möbius t-state frame sequence) plus harmonic relation results;
2. **electron-shell participants** — the quantum layer from `epac_atomic` (n, l, m_l, m_s,
   shell, subshell, hydrogenic angular id, radial nodes, Slater Z_eff, Rydberg energy);
3. **element closure** — relation `epac.subatomic.element`, carried options Z/period/group/A,
   electron configuration, valence count, surviving harmonic relations, status
   `CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS`.

- `subatomic_gonol.py` — constructor with `MODULE_BUILD` + `CONTRACTS`.
- `test_subatomic_gonol.py` — five witnesses with `CHECKS`. **15/15 tests pass** across all
  three subatomic modules; CONTRACTS↔CHECKS audit **closed** (15 contracts / 15 checks).
- `receipts/gonol_*.json` — historical EDCM-constructor receipts, superseded as
  constructor identity. Replay of the current constructor is `replay_public_gonol`.

| Element | Gonol receipt digest |
|---|---|
| H | `3191f743…bc22b` |
| He | `37991f4b…6c3c37` |
| Li | `ff23abd7…312c95` |
| C | `f951b648…45f0e3` |

Layers stay distinct inside the gonol: nucleus and electron shells remain individually
addressable participants with their own source_ids. No position operation, no Möbius coupling
law, and no scale interchange is introduced. Standing is `implemented-candidate`,
`selection_effect: none` — the gonol is a candidate, not selected canon.

## 13. Extension to iron and symbol-abbreviation coupling (2026-08-22)

- **Extended quantum layer** (`extended_atomic.py`): Z=1..26. Z≤18 delegates byte-identically
  to `epac_atomic`; Z=19..26 uses declared ground-state configurations (K through Fe), including
  the Cr `4s1.3d5` exception. Fe = `1s2.2s2.2p6.3s2.3p6.4s2.3d6`, A=56.
- **Subatomic gonol now supports all 26 symbols** (`subatomic_gonol.py`), using
  `extended_atomic` and the EPAC Public Gonol constructor (`epac_public_gonol`).
- **Nomenclature abbreviation** (`symbol_coupling.py`): letters are **not** a physics
  domain. A chemical-symbol abbreviation is a name attached to a closed element gonol.
  Two-letter names (He, Fe) are two ordered name-characters, not physical `(z, x)` /
  `(z, y)` couplings and not nuclear-Z charge states. Physics 3-structure stays on
  atom instances only.
- Evidence (at time of writing): **26/26 subatomic tests pass**; sibling epac suite **29 tests OK**;
  CONTRACTS↔CHECKS audit **closed** (26 contracts / 26 checks).

## 14. Broader subatomic coverage (subsequent work)

- **Extended atomic + subatomic gonol broadened to Z=1..36** (K through Kr).
  - `element_affixiation_candidate.py`: ISOTOPE_DEFAULTS now includes Co..Kr.
  - `extended_atomic.py`: CONFIGURATIONS_19_36, PERIOD_GROUP_19_36, ISOTOPE_DEFAULTS_19_36;
    atomic_record and iter_table now support Z<=36 (standard Aufbau + known exceptions for Cr/Cu).
  - `subatomic_gonol.py`: SUPPORTED_SYMBOLS = 36.
- All 36 symbols produce deterministic, byte-identical-replayable subatomic gonols.
- Unique receipt digests across the full table (36 distinct).
- Full test suite (primary + mirrors) remains green.
- Historical Z=1..26 artifacts and receipts are preserved; new elements add new receipts.
- Status remains `CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS`. No change to unresolved items (UCNS position operations, harmonic notation, no canonical epac repo).

## 15. Nuclear harmonic layer extension (next maximal after Z=1..36 identity/quantum)

To match the breadth of the nucleus identity and quantum shell layers, the physically sourced harmonic candidates were extended to the alpha-conjugate (even-even N=Z) chain through the current table limit.

- Added nuclide facts for O-16, Ne-20, Mg-24, Si-28, S-32, Ar-36, Ca-40 (compiled data, web-pinned).
- Updated `CANDIDATES` participants and recurrence mappings for the five existing candidate kinds to include the new alpha-conjugates where the declared relation applies (alpha-cluster recurrence, N/Z=1, 0+ spin-parity, binding-per-nucleon commensurability within tolerance, p<->n self-mirror).
- `recurrence_test` now returns a dict whose keys are exactly the `participants` declared on that candidate (contractual).
- All new alpha-conjugates satisfy the alpha-cluster recurrence by the declared rule.
- For N/Z, spin-parity, and inversion, the new even-even N=Z nuclei satisfy the "recurs" condition; Li-7 continues to not satisfy the even-even symmetries (preserved behavior).
- Test updated to assert the per-candidate key contract + receipt determinism + preservation of original H/He/Li/C outcomes.
- Full suite restored to green.
- This is the direct counterpart on the harmonic side to the earlier identity/quantum broadening.

Status for the extended set remains `CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS / hmmm`. No physics claim, no canon, no UCNS position operation or harmonic notation invented.

Unresolved items unchanged.

## 16. Harmonic survival integrated into the (enlarged) molecular geometry experiment (next maximal)

The nuclear harmonic candidates layer (alpha-conjugate broadened through Ca-40, Z=1..36 coverage) is now consumed inside the preregistered molecular geometry experiment.

- Added `_harmonic_survival_signature(formula)`: molecule-level union of surviving candidate ids. For each constituent symbol, include every candidate for which at least one of its isotope participants for that symbol satisfies the declared recurrence (identical rule to the one used inside `subatomic_gonol._harmonic_survives_symbol`).
- `compare_after_construction` now computes the signature for every constructed formula and exposes it as:
  - `readouts["harmonic_survival"]`
  - `partitions["harmonic_survival"]`
  - `standings["harmonic_survival_as_sealed_shape_prediction"]`
- `quantify_distinguishing_power` includes `harmonic_survival` class counts, splits/collapses (vs frozen known), and pairwise contingency (original 5 formulas only).
- All known-side metrics and standings continue to respect the frozen `ORIGINAL_PREREG` policy exactly; new formulas participate only in construction-side counts and broader quantification.
- Observed on frozen known 5: 3 distinct harmonic signatures, splits_known=1, collapses=2, pairwise fp=1/fn=2 (total_pairs=10), standing FALSIFIED.
- Observed on full constructed set (9 formulas): 4 distinct harmonic signatures.
- New test witness added; full discover now 39 tests OK.
- Receipts and behavior remain deterministic (participant-driven recurrence_test contract).

The integration is a direct, minimal use of the just-broadened harmonic layer inside the existing molecular experiment. No sealed labels are used in construction; no VSEPR or cartesian geometry is imported; no UCNS position operations are invented.

Status remains `CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS / hmmm`. No change to prior unresolved items.

## 17. Nuclear harmonic survival carried on molecule PublicGonol receipts (next maximal)

The molecule-level nuclear harmonic survival (union of surviving candidates across constituents) is now a carried fact on every closed molecule PublicGonol receipt, exactly parallel to the "harmonic-surviving" carried option on subatomic/element gonols.

- `epac_molecular.construct_molecule` computes the value from the subatomic layer and passes it as `carried_options` to `construct_public_gonol` under the key `"harmonic-surviving"`.
- The `MolecularConstruction` invariants store both `"harmonic_survival"` and `"subatomic_harmonic_survival"` (identical value).
- `compare_after_construction` sources the `harmonic_survival` family from the receipt's carried_options (authoritative carried fact), while `subatomic_harmonic_survival` remains the per-atom view.
- Top-level distinguishing facts for the harmonic family are exposed:
  - `harmonic_collapses_h2o_with_co2`
  - `harmonic_distinguishes_h2o_from_co2`
  - `linear_class_split_by_harmonic_survival`
- These feed the same `_standing` and `_quantify_distinguishing_power` paths (frozen `ORIGINAL_PREREG` policy on the known 5; full constructed set for class counts).
- Replay determinism: `replay_public_gonol` on a molecule receipt reproduces the identical `"harmonic-surviving"` carried value and the same receipt digest.
- Observed: same 3 signatures on the frozen known 5, 4 on the full 9; FALSIFIED standing; splits/collapses/pairwise as previously quantified.
- New test witnesses: carried presence + consistency with invariants, and exact preservation under replay.
- Full discover: 42 tests OK. All receipts remain byte-replay deterministic.

This completes the lift of the nuclear harmonic layer (alpha-conjugate broadened) as a carried, addressable, replayable fact through the entire EPAC Public Gonol construction pipeline: subatomic nucleus/electrons → element gonol → molecule gonol.

No sealed labels used in construction; no VSEPR or cartesian geometry; no UCNS position operations invented.

Status remains `CROSS-DOMAIN-HYPOTHESIS / hmmm`. Unresolved items unchanged.
