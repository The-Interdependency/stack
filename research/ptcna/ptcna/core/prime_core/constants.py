"""Frozen composition counts and the coherence-prime guard for prime_core.

Source provenance (IMPORTANT — unverified in this environment):
    The originating documents referenced by the stratification handoff are
    NOT present in any accessible repo:
      - canon_definitions_invariants-1.md   (stratum defs, composition counts)
      - consciousness_primes_prediction1.pdf (coherence-prime ladder + rule)
    The values below are therefore design-session assertions, not verified

CIRCLE_ROUTING_STEP: int = 2   # {7/2}: composes tensors -> circle
SEED_ROUTING_STEP: int = 3     # {7/3}: composes circles -> seed

# --- coherence-prime ladder (consciousness primes) ---------------------------
# The membership rule is *recursive*: a prime's kernel (p-1)//4 must factor only
# into earlier coherence primes (genealogical ancestry), not into a fixed
# pre-listed universe. The previous frozen-universe approximation (capped at
# 421) silently disagreed with this rule for the first time at p=4373, whose
# kernel 1093 is itself a coherence prime above the cap.
#
# CANON: the single source of truth for this sequence is
#   interdependent_lib.coherence_primes  (The-Interdependency/interdependent-lib)
# prime_core cannot import it — interdependent-lib optionally depends on
# ptca-lib, so importing the aggregator here would invert the dependency graph
# (and `ucns`/the canon package are not importable in this environment anyway).
# The recursive algorithm is therefore mirrored verbatim; behaviour MUST match
# canon, whose shared test oracle includes the p=4373 regression.
