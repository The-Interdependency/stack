Stateful PCEA instance.

PCEAInstance tracks last_state (a list of seeds) automatically. After each
encrypt or decrypt call, last_state advances to the current plaintext seeds
so that sender and receiver stay synchronized without manual state management.

Each seed is a 7×7 structure: 7 circles × 7 tensors. Each circle is itself
a tensor; each seed is itself a tensor.
