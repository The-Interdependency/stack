Prefix-read structural break for the UCNS-KEM regime.

The pruning-scaling result eliminated LINEAR-search attacks but flagged a
sublinear/algebraic attack as the remaining danger. This module finds it.
The break is not a faster search — it is a DIRECT RECONSTRUCTION that does
not search the key space at all, and it is independent of both key-space
size and payload depth.

Mechanism. UCNS normalization puts a factor's first host angle at 0.
Therefore in P = A ⊠ B the prefix block P[0:q] (q = |B's host|) IS B's
host data verbatim — this is exactly Phase 1 of left_quotient, which the
algorithm relies on to recover B. An attacker exploits the same fact in
reverse: for each divisor q of |P.A_plus|, read the prefix block as a
candidate B, then recover A by right_quotient(P, B). No key-space
enumeration occurs.

Measured: reconstruction succeeds 100/100 (flat) and 80/80 (depth-1
nested). Payload nesting does NOT block it — right_quotient handles the
composed payloads, so reading the prefix block verbatim still yields a
consistent factor pair. Cost is O(divisors(|P.A_plus|)), independent of
|key space|.

CONCLUSION: the key-space-restricted UCNS-KEM regime is BROKEN. A
public product structurally exposes a factor in its prefix; making the
key space large or the objects deep does not help, because the attack
never enumerates the key space and the quotient absorbs the depth. This
is a decisive negative result for the factorization/quotient-based KEM
construction as specified.

This does NOT affect PCEA's symmetric security (key management;
contract.py). It closes ONE construction, not the possibility of any UCNS
asymmetric primitive — but any future candidate must defeat the
prefix-read reconstruction, which the forward-composition-plus-quotient
design cannot.

MEASURE, not assert. Skipped without ucns.
